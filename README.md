# Zotero to Markdown

Generate Markdown files from Zotero annotations (Zotero Beta). 
With new Zotero PDF Reader and Note Editor, all highlights are saved in Zotero databases.
The highlights are NOT saved in the PDF file unless you export the highlights in order to save them.

You can use the following commands to generate markdown files for your code


## Installation 
You can install the library by running 
```shell
pip install zotero2md
```

Note: If you do not have pip installed on your system, you can follow the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
